# Lord of the Flag: The Unfinished Chat

**Category**: Web

**Author**: knapstack, vakzz

**Description**: 
Sauron is back, but this time to throw the middle internet into the darkness. We know through Gandalf that he is been using a fancy chat app.

The flag of power lies deep within the realms of his kingdom. We need you hobbits to get it. But, be careful - It's a dangerous business going out of your door.
