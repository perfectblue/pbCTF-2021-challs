# Steroid stream

**Category**: Crypto

**Author**: rbtree

**Description**:
I found a weird stream cipher scheme. Can you break this?

**Hints**: None

**Public Files**:
 * dist

**Solution**:
Because `fake` values are computed awkwardly, this is easily solvable
with matroid intersections. If you don't know well about it,
